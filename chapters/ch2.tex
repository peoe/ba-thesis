\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Notation}

Throughout this thesis we will be using the following notation.

\begin{itemize}
	\item $\sigma$-algebras will not be explicitly stated for measures and measurable spaces. Measurable functions can thus be written as \map[f]{X}{Y} instead of \map[f]{(X, \mathcal{X})}{(Y, \mathcal{Y})}.
	\item The notion of weak convergence of measures (\weak{\mu_n}{\mu}) will be used instead of weak-* convergence.
	\item \MF{X}{Y}: The set of all measurable functions \map[f]{X}{Y}.
	\item \M{X}: The set of all finite measures on the underlying set $X$.
	\item \PM{X}: The set of all probability measures on $X$.
	\item \TP{\mu}{\nu}: The set of all transport plans from $\mu$ to $\nu$.
	\item \push{\mu}: The push-forward of the measure $\mu$. Sometimes also called the image measure.
	\item \CF{X}: The set of all continuous functions \map[f]{X}{\R}.
	\item \CF[b]{X}: The set of all bounded $f \in \CF{X}$.
	\item $\overline{\R}$: The set $\R \cup \{ -\infty, \infty \}$.
\end{itemize}
