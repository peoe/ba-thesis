Throughout this thesis we will be using the following notation.

\begin{itemize}
	\item For ease of notation, we will not be explicitly stating the $\sigma$-algebras for measure and measurable spaces. As such, measurable functions can be written as \map[f]{X}{Y} instead of \map[f]{(X, \mathcal{X})}{(Y, \mathcal{Y})}.
	\item \MF{X}{Y}: The set of all measurable functions \map[f]{X}{Y}.
	\item \M{X}: The set of all measures on the underlying set $X$.
	\item \PM{X}: The set of all probability measures on $X$.
	\item \TP{\mu}{\nu}: The set of all transport plans from $\mu$ to $\nu$.
	\item \push{\mu}: The push-forward of the measure $\mu$. Sometimes also called the image measure.
	\item \leb[d]{\cdot}: The $d$-dimensional Lebesgue measure.
	\item \CF{X}: The set of all continuous functions \map[f]{X}{\R}.
	\item \CF[b]{X}: The set of all bounded $f \in \CF{X}$.
\end{itemize}
